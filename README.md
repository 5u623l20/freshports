**The Place For Ports**

FreshPorts lists the change made to the FreeBSD ports tree. If you wish, 
FreshPorts can email you when your favourite port has been updated.

FreshPorts is not the place to report errors or request changes. You should 
do that on the [FreeBSD Ports](https://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/freebsd-ports) mailing list. We do not maintain ports. We do not 
create ports. We do not fix ports. We just tell you what others have been doing 
to the Ports tree.

At present, this repo contains only the website code.  It does not contain the
database or or commit-loading code. You won't be able to run your own
FreshPorts website with what's here now.
