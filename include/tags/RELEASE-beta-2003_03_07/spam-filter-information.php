<BIG><BIG>SPAM FILTERS:</BIG></BIG> If you are using spam filters which require confirmation
of incoming email, these reports will be coming from the following domains:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE CLASS="code">
<TABLE CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="5" BORDER="1">
<TR><TD>domain</TD><TD>reason</TD></TR>
<TR><TD NOWRAP><CODE CLASS="code">freshports.org</CODE></TD><TD>All reports originate from that domain.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD NOWRAP><CODE CLASS="code">unixathome.org</CODE></TD><TD>The websites is hosted on a box in that domain.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD NOWRAP><CODE CLASS="code">langille.org</CODE></TD><TD>If I need to write to you, it will come from that domain.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


Ensure that you update your spam filters to allow such incoming messages.  
If your spam tools require that a confirmation be sent, you'll have
to modify things as no confirmations will be sent for FreshPorts messages.
