The process of transferring all accounts from this website to the new FreshPorts website has commenced.  
A dry run will be done first, then we will get some users to verify their accounts and see if everything is OK.  
If all is well, a notice will be posted here warning people not to update their data or risk losing changes,
and the final data transfer will be done and the new website will go live.</BIG></BIG><BR>
