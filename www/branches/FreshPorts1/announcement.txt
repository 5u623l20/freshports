<BIG>CASH WANTED!</BIG> The domain is up for renewal.  As such I am asking for those among you who can afford to
donate cash, to please transfer via paypal to my account (donations@freebsddiary.org).  Any excess payment
will be applied to the running of other domains (e.g. the FreeBSD Diary) and running expenses.  Thank you.
