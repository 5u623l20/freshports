<p>Dan Langille thought up the idea, found the data sources, bugged people to 
write scripts, and did the html and database work. But he certainly didn't 
do it alone.</p>

<p>Olaf wrote did the perl script for the log catcher.</p>

<p>icmpecho wrote the awk code for the log catcher and the log munger.</p>

<p>Adriel helped me with perl syntax.</p>

<p>Acme talked over data sources with me.</p>

<p>John Polstra and Satoshi Asami provided insight into cvs and ports as well
as encouragement.</p>

<p>Laz hung around, criticized, and suggested security improvments.</p>

<p>halflife did some prototype coding for me.</p>

<p>David Bushong did a FreshBSD site which is a freshmeat-look site.</p>

<p>And various people on undernet's #nz.general ad #freebsd helped me with 
scripts and ideas.  That's not to mention that channel on efnet which I won't 
name just so it stays a secret.</p>
